In order to draw conclusions from the data set provided by this group, one can use the included
R script to summarize the data by activity and subject participant.   A large number (561) of
data variabless were collected and included in the group's data for each individual observation.
This includes some significant processing that is best understood from the direct source: the actual
group's data set and included information files.  This README is concerned solely with explaining the 
usage and purpose of the script contained within this repo.  Please follow the next instructions
to properly use this script.

# First things first...

Before you may effectively use the run_analysis.R script, you need to:

1. Download the appropriate data set from its original source.  The link is [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)
2. Unzip the data into an appropriate working directory.
3. Open R.
4. Set your working directory, using setwd(), to the filepath of the UCI HAR DATASET you have now unzipped.
5. Download the run_analysis.R script and place it into the working directory.

# Time to do this thing...

Now that your data and script and in the correct directory, which also happens to be your current
R working directory, you can run the analysis by doing the following:

1. Source your run_analysis.R script by
